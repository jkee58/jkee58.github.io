<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a M.S. student in the Computer Systems and Intelligence (CSI) Lab at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) supervised by Prof. Yusung Kim. Prior to studying at SKKU, I received double bachelor's degrees in Electronic Engineering (EE) and AI Convergence at Soongsil University in 2022.

My research interest lies on computer vision based on deep learning. Current research directions include self-supervised, domain-adaptive, and multimodal learning for dense prediction task such as semantic segmentation.
